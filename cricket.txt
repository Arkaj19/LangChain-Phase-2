Cricket is a globally popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players each. Originating in England in the 16th century, it has grown into one of the most followed games worldwide, especially in countries such as India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.

The game is played on a circular or oval grass field with a 22-yard pitch at the center. Each team takes turns to bat and bowl (field). The batting side tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the bowling/fielding side tries to limit runs and dismiss batters.

There are several formats of cricket:

Test cricket – the longest form, played over five days.

One Day Internationals (ODIs) – limited to 50 overs per side.

Twenty20 (T20) – the shortest international format, with 20 overs per side.

Key skills in cricket include batting, bowling (fast or spin), fielding, and wicketkeeping. Strategy and team coordination are as important as individual skill. Major global events like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the T20 World Cup attract massive audiences and showcase the sport’s excitement.

Cricket continues to evolve with innovations such as franchise leagues (like the Indian Premier League), advanced analytics, and new technologies for umpiring decisions, making it one of the most dynamic and engaging sports in the world.
